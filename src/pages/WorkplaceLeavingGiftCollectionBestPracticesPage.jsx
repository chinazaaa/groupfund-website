              <h2>Why Office Leaving Collections Get Awkward</h2>
              <p>
                Being the person “in charge of the collection” often means handling cash, sharing bank details, and sending uncomfortable reminders to coworkers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Typical problems include:
              </p>
              <ul className="feature-list">
                <li>Old‑school envelopes going missing or not reaching remote teammates</li>
                <li>Bank details shared in multiple chats and channels</li>
                <li>No single view of who has contributed and how much is left</li>
                <li>Feeling uncomfortable chasing senior colleagues or people you barely know</li>
                <li>Scrambling to buy a last‑minute gift because money came in late</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              <h2>Best Practices for Workplace Leaving Gift Collections</h2>

              <div className="use-case-card">
                <h3>1. Agree the Plan with One or Two Colleagues First</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Why it matters:</strong> A clear plan makes it easier to communicate and avoids back‑and‑forth in public channels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How to do it:</strong> Decide roughly what kind of gift you want, a ballpark budget, and who will actually purchase it once the collection is done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep this small planning group to 2–3 people so decisions stay quick and simple.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="use-case-card">
                <h3>2. Suggest a Simple, Optional Amount</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Colleagues are more likely to contribute when expectations are clear and the amount feels optional, not pressured.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How to do it:</strong> Pick a default contribution (for example, £5–£10) and make it clear that any amount is welcome, including not contributing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> In your Workplace Group description, write something like “Suggested contribution: £5–£10 (totally optional).”
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="use-case-card">
                <h3>3. Use One Shared Collection Link Across the Company</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Multiple bank details and cash at desks make tracking almost impossible, especially with remote and hybrid teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How to do it:</strong> Create a dedicated Workplace Group for the leaving gift and share the invite code in Slack, Teams, email, or your main announcement channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> Pin the link in the relevant channel so people can find it quickly over a few days.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="use-case-card">
                <h3>4. Set a Clear Deadline Before the Leaving Date</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without a deadline, people intend to contribute but forget until it is too late to buy a thoughtful gift.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How to do it:</strong> Choose a firm cut‑off a few days before the last working day and mention it every time you share the invite code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> Use wording like “We’ll close the collection on Wednesday at 3pm so we can buy the gift in time for Friday.”
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="use-case-card">
                <h3>5. Send Company‑Wide Reminders, Not Individual Chasing</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Directly nudging individuals can feel uncomfortable, especially across different levels and teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How to do it:</strong> Post 1–2 friendly reminders in the same channel where you first shared the link, thanking those who have already contributed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep the tone light: “If you’d like to chip in for [Name]’s leaving gift, you can still use the link below — we’re closing later today.”
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="use-case-card">
                <h3>6. Keep the Collection Transparent for Organisers</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Why it matters:</strong> As the organiser, you need a clear view of how much has been raised and whether the budget matches the gift idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How to do it:</strong> Use your Workplace Group to see the running total and number of contributors so you can adjust the gift if needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> If you raise more than expected, upgrade the main gift or add a card, flowers, or a small extra.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="use-case-card">
                <h3>7. Close the Loop and Thank Everyone</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Colleagues like to know what their contribution went towards, and it builds goodwill for future collections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How to do it:</strong> After buying the gift, share a short message and (if appropriate) a photo of the gift or the handover moment in the same channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> A quick “Thank you to everyone who contributed — we were able to get [Gift] for [Name]” is enough.
                </p>

              <h2>Example Workplace Collection Flow</h2>

              <div className="scaling-card">
                <h3>Step 1: Create Your Workplace Group</h3>
                <p>Set the occasion as a leaving gift, add the colleague’s name, and write a short note about the plan for the present.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams, departments, or whole companies organising a single shared gift or voucher.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="scaling-card">
                <h3>Step 2: Share the Invite Code in Your Main Channel</h3>
                <p>Post the GroupFund invite code in Slack, Teams, or email with the suggested amount and deadline so everyone sees the same information.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Hybrid and remote teams where not everyone is in the office for a physical envelope.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="scaling-card">
                <h3>Step 3: Track the Total and Buy the Gift</h3>
                <p>Watch contributions come in, send one or two reminders before the deadline, then close the group and purchase the agreed gift or voucher.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Avoiding last‑minute scrambles and making sure the gift matches the budget you actually raised.</p>

              <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
              <ul className="best-practices-list">
                <li><strong>Using cash envelopes only:</strong> Remote and hybrid colleagues often miss out or cannot participate easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Sharing multiple bank details:</strong> Keep everything in one Workplace Group instead of scattered transfers.</li>
                <li><strong>No suggested amount:</strong> People hesitate when they do not know what is normal to give.</li>
                <li><strong>Announcing too late:</strong> Give colleagues enough time to contribute before the leaving date.</li>
                <li><strong>Not closing the loop:</strong> Always thank contributors and show what the collection achieved.</li>
