              <h2>How to Share Peacock with GroupFund</h2>
              <ol className="how-it-works-list">
                <li>Create a Subscription Group and select "Peacock" as the platform.</li>
                <li>Set your billing date to match when Peacock charges your account each month.</li>
                <li>Add your payment account details (bank transfer, mobile money, etc.) where members send their share.</li>
                <li>
                  Add clear instructions in the group description (e.g., "Paid members get Peacock profile access - message after payment for login").
                </li>
                <li>Invite housemates, family, or friends using your unique GroupFund invite link or code.</li>
                <li><strong>For auto-pay (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, or AUD):</strong> Members enable auto-pay and Stripe automatically charges them each month - no action required. This creates true recurring subscriptions with automatic monthly billing.</li>
                <li><strong>For manual payments:</strong> Members receive automatic reminders before the billing date so they pay on time, members mark their payment as "Paid" after sending money, and you (the admin) confirm each payment as it arrives</li>
