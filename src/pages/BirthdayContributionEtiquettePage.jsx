              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Organizing group contributions involves more than just collecting money. It's about maintaining relationships, showing respect, and ensuring fairness. This guide covers the etiquette and best practices that help groups organize contributions smoothly without awkwardness or conflict - whether for Birthday Groups, Subscription Groups, or General Groups.

              <h2>Do's: Best Practices</h2>
              
              <h3>✅ Set Clear Expectations</h3>
              <p>
                Always communicate contribution amounts, deadlines, and expectations clearly from the start. Everyone should know exactly what's expected of them.
              </p>

              <h3>✅ Use Fixed Amounts</h3>
              <p>
                Set a fixed contribution amount per person. This ensures fairness and eliminates confusion about who should pay what.
              </p>

              <h3>✅ Be Transparent</h3>
              <p>
                Make payment statuses visible to all members. Transparency builds trust and prevents misunderstandings.
              </p>

              <h3>✅ Send Reminders Respectfully</h3>
              <p>
                Use automatic reminders instead of personal messages. This removes awkwardness and ensures everyone gets the same professional reminder.
              </p>

              <h3>✅ Confirm Receipt</h3>
              <p>
                Celebrants should confirm when they receive payments. This closes the loop and shows appreciation.
              </p>

              <h3>✅ Be Understanding</h3>
              <p>
                Understand that people may have financial difficulties. Be flexible when appropriate, but maintain fairness for the group.
              </p>

              <h3>✅ Thank Contributors</h3>
              <p>
                Celebrants should acknowledge and thank contributors. A simple thank you goes a long way.
              </p>

              <h3>✅ Keep Records</h3>
              <p>
                Maintain records of all contributions. This helps resolve disputes and provides transparency.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="resource-section">
              <h2>Don'ts: Things to Avoid</h2>
              
              <h3>❌ Don't Make It Personal</h3>
              <p>
                Avoid personal attacks or judgment when following up on payments. Keep communication professional and respectful.
              </p>

              <h3>❌ Don't Use Public Shaming</h3>
              <p>
                Never call out members publicly for not paying. Use private reminders and automatic systems instead.
              </p>

              <h3>❌ Don't Change Amounts Mid-Year</h3>
              <p>
                Avoid changing contribution amounts during the year unless absolutely necessary. This creates confusion and unfairness.
              </p>

              <h3>❌ Don't Assume Everyone Can Afford It</h3>
              <p>
                When setting amounts, consider everyone's financial situation. Choose amounts that work for the group.
              </p>

              <h3>❌ Don't Forget to Contribute</h3>
              <p>
                If you're in the group, make sure you contribute on time. Lead by example.
              </p>

              <h3>❌ Don't Ignore Late Payments</h3>
              <p>
                Address late payments promptly but respectfully. Use automatic reminders and tracking systems.
              </p>

              <h3>❌ Don't Make Exceptions Without Group Approval</h3>
              <p>
                Don't make exceptions for some members without discussing with the group. Maintain fairness.
              </p>

              <h3>❌ Don't Use Group Chats for Payment Tracking</h3>
              <p>
                Avoid using WhatsApp groups or chat apps for tracking payments. Use a dedicated system instead.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="resource-section">
              <h2>Handling Difficult Situations</h2>
              
              <h3>Late Payments</h3>
              <p>
                When someone pays late, use automatic reminders rather than personal messages. Track reliability scores to identify patterns. Address consistently late payers privately and professionally.
              </p>

              <h3>Financial Difficulties</h3>
              <p>
                If a member is having financial difficulties, discuss options privately. Consider temporary adjustments or payment plans, but maintain group fairness.
              </p>

              <h3>Disputes</h3>
              <p>
                If there's a dispute about payments, refer to your records. Transparent tracking systems help resolve disputes quickly and fairly.
              </p>

              <h3>Members Who Want to Leave</h3>
              <p>
                If someone wants to leave the group, handle it respectfully. Ensure they've fulfilled their current obligations before they leave.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h3>Use Automation</h3>
              <p>

              <h3>Be Clear and Concise</h3>
              <p>

              </p>

              <h3>Provide Context</h3>
              <p>
                When sending reminders, include context like the birthday date, deadline, and amount.
